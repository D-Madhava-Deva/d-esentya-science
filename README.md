## 🌌 Towards a Living Science of Reputation, Presence, and Digital Worth

Welcome to the official scientific archive for the Esentya Protocol.  
This repository hosts **all whitepapers, scientific articles, and peer-reviewed manuscripts** developed through the Esentya project.

## 🧬 About Esentya

**Esentya Protocol** is a new class of decentralized architecture, uniting blockchain, neuroscience, philosophy, and social theory to design “living protocols”—where reputation is dynamic, cyclical, and based on verifiable presence and contribution.  
We envision a digital ecosystem in which *worth is not bought, but continuously earned and validated*, and where **time, service, and ritual** are foundational primitives of trust.

## 📚 Contents

This repository includes:

- **Whitepapers:** Deep-dives into core protocol theory and implementation  
- **Scientific Articles:** Peer-reviewed studies, formal methods, and interdisciplinary essays  
- **Historical Papers:** Chronology of our scientific journey—each milestone paper documents the “why” and “how” behind every protocol decision  
- **Bibliographies:** Every document is rigorously referenced, connecting Esentya to established science in cryptography, cognitive science, anthropology, and systems theory

See the `/papers/` directory for all current articles.

## 🔬 How We Work

- Every paper or article is **documented as a scientific manuscript**, following academic standards (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, references).
- We use **third-party, peer-reviewed citations** for every claim and concept.  
- All major protocol decisions are first articulated in whitepapers, then discussed in open review, before implementation.
- Our historical conversations (“Talks”) are preserved and periodically translated into formal papers, turning process into publication.

## 🤝 Contribution and Peer Review

- **Pull Requests:** Anyone can submit suggestions, reviews, or new research.
- **Peer Review:** Every major paper is open for comment, scientific review, and improvement—join us in building a transparent scientific community.

## 🌍 Why Publish in the Open?

Esentya’s vision is to create **transparent, auditable, and living knowledge**—making both the code and the science behind the protocol fully available.  
We believe that real progress happens when scientific inquiry is open, referenced, and co-created by a global community.
